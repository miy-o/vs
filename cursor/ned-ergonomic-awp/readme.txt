Author's description:

An Arctic Warfare Police Sniper Rifle (AWP for short) cursor set with a focus on feeling tactile, without compromising on usability. everything is outlined for visibility over light or dark backgrounds, and some are animated for extra effect.

This is my first cursor pack, let me know if you like it! I made them in Aseprite before importing them to RW Cursor editor for testing, cleanup and formatting.
